# GTAS Centralized Network

Welcome to GTAS - **Global Tech Advancements Solutions** - where we're building a decentralized network with a centralized approach for better management, efficiency, and security.

## Our Vision
GTAS aims to revolutionize how data moves across the globe by creating a network where nodes (hotspots) provide coverage, earning GTAS tokens for their contribution. We're looking for developers passionate about blockchain, IoT, and network technology to join us as **partners** in this venture.

## What We're Building

### Core Components:

- **Node Registration Smart Contract**: For onboarding nodes into the network.
- **Token Distribution Smart Contract**: To manage and distribute GTAS tokens as rewards.
- **Mapping Backend**: Visualize the network's coverage with node locations.
- **Basic Frontend**: A user interface for interacting with the network.

### Expansion:

- **Staking & Governance**: For network participants to have a say and earn additional rewards.
- **Liquidity Pools & Order Book**: Enabling trading of network services or data.
- **Enhanced Mapping**: Interactive, real-time network visualization.

### Hardware:

- **Miner Hotspots**: We're envisioning a network of IoT devices or hotspots that connect users to our decentralized network, similar to models like Helium but with our unique spin.

## Developer Opportunities

### We Need Your Skills!

- **Web Developers**: 
  - Build and maintain our project website.
  - Create a user-friendly frontend for node management, token interaction, and network visualization.

- **Blockchain Developers**: 
  - Develop and secure our smart contracts on the Solana blockchain.
  - Work on network protocols, consensus mechanisms, or integration with existing blockchain tech.

- **Backend Developers**: 
  - Enhance our mapping services, manage node data, and handle API interactions.
  - Work on data persistence, real-time updates, and scalability.

- **IoT & Hardware Specialists**: 
  - Help design or integrate hardware for our miner hotspots.
  - Ensure these devices can efficiently interact with our network.

- **Security Experts**: 
  - Audit our systems, suggest improvements, and ensure the network's integrity.

### Partnership Model

While we can't offer direct payment, we propose a **partnership** where:

- **Token Rewards**: Developers will receive GTAS tokens for their contributions, tied to the success and growth of the network.
- **Equity in the Project**: We're open to discussing equity or profit-sharing models based on contributions and commitment.
- **Community Leadership**: Active developers can gain roles in community governance, influencing the project's direction.
- **Exposure**: Work on a groundbreaking project, gaining visibility in the blockchain and IoT spaces.
